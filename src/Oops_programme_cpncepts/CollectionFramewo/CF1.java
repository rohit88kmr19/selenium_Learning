        // Insertion is also very difficult here as first we have to shift the array and then we have to link.
        // Size Fixed, no inbuilt functions available in the normal array., sorting, updating, deleting, appending, finding.
        // Array can store one type of data type. For ex - if Int is stored then it will store integer only.
        // Array List has solved all the problems but here we can add other type of data type.
